PROJECT IS ONGOING

This project's goal is to uspkill and become more familiar with existing web based & cloud technologies.

This project will be a microservice based web application, the frontend implemented in React & and the backend using a NodeJs REST API.

MongoDB will provide persistent storage for the application while Redis caching will be leveraged for performance benefits.

The goal is for these microservices to run within Docker containers, living in a Kubernetes cluster and hosted on AWS. 

A simple web application but using some of the latest technologies.
